Within parentheses the same hierarchy as mentioned in Figure 
1.11 is operative. Also, if there are more than one set of 
parentheses, the operations within the innermost parentheses 
would be performed first, followed by the operations within 
the second innermost pair and so on. 
We must always remember to use pairs of parentheses. A 
careless imbalance of the right and left parentheses is a 
common error. Best way to avoid this error is to type ( ) and 
then type an expression inside it.
